# stucumber

A Gherkin parser and Cucumber-like implementation for JavaScript.  Used by [gherkin-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gherkin-jest) and [stucumber-register](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stucumber-register).

## Overview

Gherkin allows you to write tests in sort of plain English:

```gherkin
Feature: calculator
  Scenario: adding
    Given I take the number 5
    And I take the number 3
    When I add them
    Then I will have 8
```

You define rules to support the tests in JavaScript, like so:

```js
import { cucumber } from 'stucumber';

cucumber.defineCreateWorld(() => []);

cucumber.defineRule('I take the number {int}', (world, number) => {
  world.push(number);
});

cucumber.defineRule('I add them', (world) => {
  const a = world.pop();
  const b = world.pop();
  world.push(a + b);
});

cucumber.defineRule('I will have {int}', (world, number) => {
  expect(world[world.length - 1]).to.equal(number);
});
```


## Documentation

The package consists of several parts:
  * the `Cucumber` class, which is basically the test framework
  * the `DataTable` class, for representing tabular data
  * the `parse` function, which parses gherkin source and turns it into an AST
  * a `Transformer` abstract class and `GenericTransformer` implementation, for converting
    the AST into JavaScript
  * interfaces or representing the AST, e.g. `Feature`, `Scenario`, `Clause`

Roughly speaking, given the following gherkin:

```gherkin
Feature: calculator
  Scenario: adding
    Given I take the number 5
    And I take the number 3
    When I add them
    Then I will have 8
```

The `GenericTransformer` will output something like this, depending on the options:

```js
const {cucumber} = require('stucumber');

describe('Feature: calculator', () => {
  beforeAll(() => cucumber.enterFeature([]));
  afterAll(() => cucumber.exitFeature([]));

  it('adding', () => {
    const world = cucumber.createWorld();
    return cucumber
      .enterScenario(world, [])
      .then(() => cucumber.rule('I take the number 5'))
      .then(() => cucumber.rule('I take the number 3'))
      .then(() => cucumber.rule('I add them'))
      .then(() => cucumber.rule('I will have 8'))
      .then(() => cucumber.exitScenario(world, []));
  });
})
```

## API

### `Cucumber` class

The JavaScript behind the Gherkin, for defining rules etc.

```js
import { Cucumber } from 'stucumber';
```

The methods below are meant to be called by people writing tests.  The other methods on
the class are called by translated gherkin tests.

**`defineCreateWorld(_createWorld: () => any): void`**

Defines a factory function for creating a "world", which is passed to every rule.  
This should be some object which holds the context of your test.

Parameters:
  
  * `_createWorld` - a function which returns an instance of a world, whatever
  that might be

**`defineRule(match: string, handler: RuleHandler): void`**\
**`defineRule(match: RegExp, handler: RuleHandler): void`**

Defines a rule. All rules, whether `Given`, `When`, `Then` or `And` are treated
the same way.  When a rule matches `match`, the `handler` function will be called.

Parameters:

  * `match` - either a string or regex that defines what the rule will match
  * `handler` - a function to execute when the rule is matched (see
  [`RuleHandler`](#rulehandler))

The first argument to the handler is always the `world` instance.

If `match` is a string, it can contain placeholders for matched arguments (see
[template strings](#template-strings)).  The values matched by the placeholders
will be passed to the handler in the order they appear in the string.

If `match` is a `RegExp`, any capturing groups will be passed as separate arguments
to the handler.

**`addHook(type: HookType, handler: HookHandler): void`**

Adds a hook, i.e., a function which will run before or after features or
scenarios.

Parameters:

  * `type` - the type of hook, see [`HookType`](#hooks)
  * `handler` - the function that will run, see [`HookHandler`](#hooks)

### `RuleHandler`

```js
import {RuleHandler} from 'stucumber';
```

Interface representing a handler function for a rule.  The first argument is `world`, the
value returned from the `createWorld` function.  Subsequent arguments are the values
for the capturing groups (or placeholders) defined for the rule.  The final argument is a
the data table if defined.


## Additional features

### Template strings

You can write your rules using the template string style notation:

```js
cucumber.defineRule('I have numbers {int} and {int}', (world, a, b) => {
  world.a = a;
  world.b = b;
});
```

There are 4 types that can be used as placeholders:

  * `{int}` - matches an integer (`[-+]?\d+`) and runs `parseInt` on it before passing into your handler
  * `{float}` - matches a floating point number (`[-+]?\d*(\.\d+)?`) and runs `parseFloat` on it before passing on
  * `{word}` - matches a bunch of characters up to a whitespace character (`[^\s]+`)
  * `{string}` - matches a double-quoted string and returns only the contents of the string (`"([^"]+)"`)


###  Promises

Any rule can return a promise and it will be awaited before processing the next rule.

### Annotations

You can prefix any feature or scenario with any number of annotations, which consist of a keyword prefixed by an `@` symbol:

```gherkin
@skip
Feature: I don't want this test to be run
  Scenario: a simple arithmetic test
    Given I have numbers 3 and 4
    When I add them
    Then I get 7
```

Currently there are two "special" annotations which have defined behaviour:

  * `@skip` - skips the test - outputs a `describe.skip` or `it.skip` for features and scenarios respectively
  * `@only` - only runs the annotated test - outputs a `describe.only` or `it.only` depending on the annotated item

Anything else is ignored, so could be useful for metadata, e.g. recording the associated issue number.

### Hooks

You can register functions to handle various hooks:

  * `HookType.BeforeFeatures` - runs once at the beginning of each feature
  * `HookType.BeforeScenarios` - runs at the beginning of each scenario, just after the call to `createWorld`
  * `HookType.AfterFeatures` - runs once at the end of each feature
  * `HookType.AfterScenarios` - runs at the end of each scenario

To register a handler, call `cucumber.addHook`:

```js
cucumber.addHook(HookType.BeforeEach, (world, attributes) => {
  // do some stuff
})
```

The handler functions get two parameters:

  * `world` - the world object returned from `createWorld` - for `BeforeAll` and `AfterAll` this is not relevant and is always `null`
  * `attributes` - a string array of any attributes defined on the feature and/or scenario (if relevant)

You can use the attributes parameter to do custom setup behaviour depending on attributes set on the test.  Note that a scenario
gets the attributes from both the feature and that scenario.


### Data tables

You can define data tables in your specs like so:

```gherkin
Feature: Using tables
  Scenario: lots of data
    Given lots of data
      | Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
      | Value 1a | Value 1b | Value 1c |
      | Value 2a | Value 2b | Value 2c |
    When I use 3 key-value pairs
      | Key 1 | Value 1 |
      | Key 2 | Value 2 |
      | Key 3 | Value 3 |
    And I have a list
      | Value 1 |
      | Value 2 |
      | Value 3 |
    Then I can access all that data
```

And write rules for them like so:

```js
cucumber.defineRule('lots of data', (world, table) => {
  const obj = table.asObjects();

  expect(obj[0]).toEqual({
    'Header 1': 'Value 1a',
    'Header 2': 'Value 1b',
    'Header 3': 'Value 1c'
  });

  const raw = table.raw();

  expect(raw).toEqual([
     [ 'Header 1', 'Header 2', 'Header 3' ],
     [ 'Value 1a', 'Value 1b', 'Value 1c' ],
     [ 'Value 2a', 'Value 2b', 'Value 2c' ],
  ])
});

cucumber.defineRule(/^I use (\d+) key-value pairs$/, (world, number, table) => {
  expect(number).toEqual(3);

  const obj = table.asKeyValuePairs();
  expect(obj['Key 2']).toEqual('Value 2');
});

cucumber.defineRule('I have a list', (world, table) => {
  const list = table.asList();
  expect(list).toEqual(['Value 1', 'Value 2', 'Value 3']);
});
```
